	'faq.sharing.answer': `It means the ability to: <br/>1. Share workflows with other users, so that they can also edit them, run them or inspect their executions<br/>2. Share credentials with other users, so that they can use them in their own workflows`,
	'faq.whatAreActiveWorkflows.question': '* What are active workflows?',
	'faq.whatAreActiveWorkflows.answer': `Workflows are either 'test' or 'active'. An 'active' workflow can be triggered automatically (e.g. at regular intervals, or when an event happens in another system). <br/> <br/> Note that if an active workflow contains multiple triggers, each will count as an active workflow. For example, 1 active workflow with 3 triggers will count as 3 active workflows.`,
	'faq.logStreaming.question': 'What is log streaming?',
	'faq.logStreaming.answer': `Log streaming allows you to automatically pipe n8n activity to an external log aggregator of your choice (e.g. Datadog, Splunk, syslog), allowing you to deal with them using a similar process to the one you use for other tools.`,
	'faq.whatIsAnExecution.question': 'What is an execution?',
	'faq.whatIsAnExecution.answer':
		'An execution is when n8n completes one cycle of the workflow that you’ve built. You can make as many executions as you like in any of our self-hosted plans — regardless of how complex the workflow is or how much data it uses.',
	'faq.support.question':
		'What is the difference between forum and dedicated support?',
	'faq.support.answer': `Dedicated support gives you direct access to our in-house support startup, with an SLA for response times. <br/> <br/> Forum support is offered on the <a href="https://community.n8n.io/" target="_blank">n8n community forum</a>, which consists of over 4,000 tech enthusiasts and professionals plus our community engineers.`,
	'faq.whatAreTestWorkflows.question': `What are test workflows?`,
	'faq.whatAreTestWorkflows.answer': `Workflows are either 'test' or 'active'. A 'test' workflow is triggered by clicking a button in n8n. This is handy when building workflows as it gives you immediate feedback on whether things are working. <br/> <br/> Test workflows can be activated when they’re ready, which allows them to be triggered automatically.`,
